This web application is my side project built for fun and it's purpose was to help me deepen my knowledge about Angular Signals.

## Main features
  - Displaying list of cars
  - Displaying individual car details
  - Searching cars by various filters
  - Adding cars to the favourites list

### Displaying list of cars
This feature presents a user a list of cars from which they can take a closer look at a particular car or narrow their search with filters.
List of cars is paginated, meaning only a handful amount of cars is presented to the user initially, which means user has to scroll vertically in order to recieve another batch of car elements, leading to better overall performance and better focus for the user.

### Displaying individual car details
Users may want to take a closer look at the car details before making a purchasing decision to closely evaluate car's physical status, engine type, performance etc.
For that reason, this feature presents car details to the users, so they can be informed about that particular car.

| Car details                    |                                     |

### Searching cars by various filters
Users may want to filter cars based on their needs and preferences.
For that reason, this feature allows them to filter cars by brand, particular model, body style, equipment, exterior and interior color etc.

### Adding cars to the favourites list
Users may want to add cars to their favourites list, so they can organize their search better and ultimately save time because they have quick access to the saved cars.
